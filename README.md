Shell helpers, or shelpers if you will. I know I will.

No promises given or responsibility taken - only certification is that it
works on ~~5~~ 6 of my machines.

Copy and paste this at a shell with reckless abandon to install it:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:yellcorp/shelpers.git ~/shelpers && python3 ~/shelpers/src/install.py
```
